### Feature:
- Supports multiple games (using fsuipc/xuipc) 

  - Still under testing :
  -  FSX
  -  P3D
  -  MSFS
  -  X-Plane

-  Retrieve bids and automatically calculate the amount of fares based on load factor and variance

- Record your flights
  - Basic data (Lat, Lon, speed, altitude ...)
  - Landing data (Landing VS, Landing G)
  - Flight status (auto/manual)

- Internationalization supported (currently include English and simplified Chinese, and it's easy to add using flutter_localizations)
  
---

### Problems:
- High RAM usage (normally using 100-300mb)
- Not compatible with x32 systems
- Can't calculate the flight scores based on rules ~~(too lazy to make it compatible with all aircrafts :sweat: )~~


Work in progress...
